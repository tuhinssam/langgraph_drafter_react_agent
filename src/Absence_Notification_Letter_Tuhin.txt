Dear Director of Atlassian,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I, Tuhin, will be absent from work for five days, from [Start Date] to [End Date], due to [reason for absence, e.g., personal reasons, medical leave, etc.].

During my absence, I have made arrangements for [Colleague's Name] to cover my responsibilities to ensure that all tasks and projects continue to progress smoothly. I have briefed [Colleague's Name] on all ongoing matters and am confident in their ability to manage in my absence.
